## User Interaction and Flow:

1. **Get Weather Button:**
   - The user clicks the **"Get Weather"** button.
   - The web app highlights the first row in the "City List" table with a green border.
   - The app then fetches weather data for that city from the following API:
     - **Method:** GET
     - **URL:** `https://python3-dot-parul-arena-2.appspot.com/test?cityname=<city name>`
     - Example: `https://python3-dot-parul-arena-2.appspot.com/test?cityname=London`
   
2. **Weather Information Fetching:**
   - Once the weather data is fetched, the web app adds a new row in the "Weather Details" table.
   - The new row contains the city name, description, temperature, humidity, current date/time, and the data age (calculated as the time difference between the current time and the data fetch time in hours).
   - After the first city's data is fetched, the next city in the list is highlighted, and the process repeats.

3. **Search:**
   - The user can enter a city name in the search input box and click the **"Search"** button.
   - If the city is found in the "Weather Details" table, the corresponding row will be highlighted in yellow.

4. **Delete Row:**
   - The user can delete any row in the "Weather Details" table by clicking the **"Delete"** button associated with the respective row.
